How to run?
===========

Run following command in a terminal. This will destroy existing VMs, if you re-run it.

2-VM Setup

Kubernetes master node is capable of acting as a master/minion. In this mode, you can run the setup using only 2 Virtual machines which is convenient in many cases.

Please use following Vagrant file, if you would like to create the 2-VM setup.
